    <h2>Ladies in Tech Lunch - Saturday, August 2nd, 2014</h2>

    <p>Thanks to the generous support of the Burlington Ruby Conference and Image Relay, Girl Develop It Burlington is organizing the 2nd Annual luncheon for women from all tech communities on the first day of the conference! This lunch is free and open to women, both those who are attending the conference and from the local community, but advance RSVP is required to attend.</p>
    <p>Last year we had attendees from Girl Develop It, Rails Girls, Railsbridge, Dev Chix, Lambda Ladies, and other women in tech organizations. This is a great opportunity to meet other women and learn more about how you can get plugged in to the tech community!</p>
    <p>The 2nd Annual Ladies in Tech Lunch is a great opportunity for women attending the conference who love Ruby, or who want to learn more about Ruby, to meet others in the same boat in a fun, relaxed environment. Women from the local tech community are also welcome to attend.</p>
    <p>We cordially invite you to join us and make new friends, forge connections, and share Ruby programming stories with folks from all around the country.</p>
