    <h2 id="1purpose">1. Purpose</h2>

    <p>A primary goal of the Burlington Ruby Conference is to be inclusive to
      the largest number of attendees and speakers, with the most varied and
      diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
      friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender,
      sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion
      (or lack thereof).</p>

    <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
      participate in our conference, as well as the consequences for
      unacceptable behavior.</p>

    <p>We invite all those who participate in the Burlington Ruby Conference to
      help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

    <h2 id="2openculturecitizenship">2. Open Culture Citizenship</h2>

    <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture
      citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
      relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>

    <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
      is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of
      power that exist in society.</p>

    <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
      is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to
      the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>

    <h2 id="3expectedbehavior">3. Expected Behavior</h2>

    <ul> <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
        contribute to the health and longevity of this community.  Exercise
        consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li> <li>Attempt
        collaboration before conflict.</li> <li>Refrain from demeaning,
        discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
      community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in
      distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
      inconsequential.</li> </ul>

    <h2 id="4unacceptablebehavior">4. Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

    <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
      discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any
      participant in our community online, at all related events and in
      one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community
      business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public;
      please be respectful to all patrons of these
    locations.</p>

    <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
      related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
      inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces
      (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or
      following; harassing photography or
    recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate
    physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <h2 id="5consequencesofunacceptablebehavior">5. Consequences of Unacceptable
      Behavior</h2>

    <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and
      those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

    <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
      immediately.</p>

    <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
      organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including
      a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning
      and without refund.</p>

    <p>If an attendee or speaker is violating the Code of
    Conduct, they will be given a warning based on the severity determined by
    the conference organizers. If the grievance is severe, they will be asked to
    leave immediately and not return.</p>

    <p>If a speaker is violating the
    Code of Conduct, their talk will be ended immediately and they will receive
    a warning.  Dependent on the severity of the grievance, the speaker may be
    asked to leave the conference and banned from future Burlington Ruby
    Conferences.</p>

    <h2 id="6ifyouwitnessoraresubjecttounacceptablebehavior">6. If You Witness
      or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

    <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
      concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible via
      email at info@burlingtonrubyconference.com.</p>

    <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
      members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
      experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person
      events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person
      experiencing distress.</p>

    <p>If you feel that you are unsafe in an emergency situation, contact 911.
      For non-emergencies, the Burlington Police Department can be reached at
