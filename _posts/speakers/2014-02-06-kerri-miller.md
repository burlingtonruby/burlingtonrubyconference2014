### How to Interview and Why

An interview too often feels like a first date - awkward, strange, and not
entirely predictive of what's to follow. There are countless books and websites
to help you when you're a job seeker, but what about when you're the one doing
the hiring? Will you just ask the same puzzle questions or sort algorithm
problems? What are your metrics for evaluating or contextualizing the answers?
In this talk, I'll discuss successful practices and techniques to help you find
someone who will innovate your business, bring new energy to your team, get the
work done, AND be someone you'll want to work with.
