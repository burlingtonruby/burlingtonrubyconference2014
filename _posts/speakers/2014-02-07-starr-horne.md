### Five Machine Learning Techniques That You Can Use Today

Machine learning is everywhere: People have started to expect features like
search, voice recognition, and recommendations to be in apps.

Fortunately, you don't have to be a math whiz to make your apps smarter with
standard machine learning techniques.

In this presentation we'll cover five important machine learning techniques that
you can use today. It's a wide and shallow introduction, for Rubyists, with
plenty of simple code examples.

By the end of the presentation, you won't be an expert, but you'll know about a
class of tools you may not have realized were available.
