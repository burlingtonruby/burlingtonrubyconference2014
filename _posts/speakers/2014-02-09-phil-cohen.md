### Cooking at Shopify - Taming a Busy Kitchen with Many Chefs

We use Chef to manage a large and rapidly growing infrastructure at Shopify. Our
cookbooks are open to development not only by our Operations Team, but by all
200+ developers at the company, and we manage to maintain an environment of
continuous delivery and continuous improvement for our infrastructure. Iâ€™ll talk
about some of our workflows, internal tooling, and security considerations when
operating at our scale.

### About

Born and raised in Vermont, Phil now lives and enjoys life in the mountains near
Lake Tahoe with his wife, 3 kids, 2 cats, and a dog. He is an avid participant
in several open source communities, a musician, a teacher, a mentor, and
currently works as an Operations Engineer with Shopify. He is always interested
in remote pairing and playing word games.
