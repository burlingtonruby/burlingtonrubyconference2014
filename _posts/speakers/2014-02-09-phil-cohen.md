### Cooking Continuously - Infrastructure Automation Patterns with Chef


Well-tested code deployed frequently and automatically is nothing new for many
Rubyists, yet the idea that these practices can also be applied to
infrastructure has yet to catch on the same way. We will explore the usage of
RSpec and Minitest with Chef, and look at building an automated pipeline to
deliver your entire infrastructure from a development Vagrant image to
multi-cloud production clusters. I will discuss some workflows, tooling, and
security considerations when adopting these strategies.
