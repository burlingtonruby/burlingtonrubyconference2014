Ernie's been writing code since he was 6 years old, but only getting paid to do
so for the past 16 years or so. Sometimes he still can't believe people actually
pay us to have this much fun.

He's the author of a bunch of Rubygems, some of which might even be useful, a
contributor to Rails, a committer to Arel, and an ardent believer that all true
first person shooters are played with a mouse and keyboard.
