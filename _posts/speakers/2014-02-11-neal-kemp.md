### Effectively Testing Services

Our Ruby world is becoming increasingly service oriented. Even in trivial
applications, we often glue on multiple services ranging from Twitter to AWS.
Services can, however, be confusing to test.

Many questions arise such as: How thoroughly should I test a service? Should I
stub out responses or consume an API in test mode? How do I know a service is
returning what I believe it returns?

In this talk, Neal will answer these questions and more so that you may test
services more effectively.
