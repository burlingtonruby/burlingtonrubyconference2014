Sandi Metz has thirty years of experience working on projects that survived to
grow and change; her book ["Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby"](http://poodr.com) is an outgrowth of this experience. Dealing with long
lived applications has left her deeply biased towards practical solutions that
produce working software that is easy to change. She believes in simple code and
straightforward explanations.

Sandi worked for many years at Duke University and now independently consults
and teaches. She lives in Durham, North Carolina, where her daily bicycle
commute now consists of a loop that starts and ends at her house.
