### Interface Writing - Code for Humans

We build systems to help real people. But honestly, are we being that helpful in
our interfaces? Or are we treating the copy as an afterthought and letting
people fend for themselves? Instead of debating the latest design trends, let's
reflect on something that isn't going away: the text on your website.

In this session, we'll look at how strings, labels, forms, and flows shape the
user experience. You'll learn how to write clear copy and guide your readers
through multipart interfaces in a friendly way.
