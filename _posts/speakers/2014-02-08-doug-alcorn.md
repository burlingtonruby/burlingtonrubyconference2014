### How to Consume Lots of Data

Concurrency is all the rage. When you have tons of data being shoved down your
throat, you need all the help you can get. All the cool kids are turning to
alternatives to try and keep up: node.js, clojure, erlang, elixir, Go. Popular
thinking is that Ruby is too slow and “won’t scale.” But our favorite friend can
support it very well. In this talk we’ll take a look at the actor pattern in
Ruby with Celluloid and compare to similar solutions in other languages.
