### Apprenticeships - I implore you!

The increase in web development vocational programs means a steady supply of
junior developers, but are we prepared to help them become productive members of
our teams?

These programs were created in response to the need for more developers, but I
fear without apprenticeships to bridge the gap, we're simply moving the
bottleneck upstream.

In the absence of an established, structured program, I've had to figure out
what it means to be a software apprentice and ensure I'm building skills and
learning best practices daily. Conversely, the senior developers have had to
think about how to integrate apprentices and provide purposeful learning
opportunities.

In this talk, I'll share my experience coming from a vocational web development
school and the apprenticeship program we're developing at Democracy Works, Inc.
