### Breaking up with the asset pipeline

Have you ever had to wait 30 seconds for your front end app to load in
development?

You must be using the Rails Asset Pipeline.

This talk will show you a better way.

Decoupling your Front End application from your Rails API gives you the best of
both the Javascript and the Rails world. It will accelerate your development and
help you write better, more maintainable code.

Forget About:
* JS Gem dependencies
* Asset Pipeline manifests
* Getting distracted during page refreshes

Learn About:
* Cross Origin Requests
* API Authentication without sessions (OAuth 2.0?)
* JavaScript dependencies management
* Javascript build tools
* Source Maps
* Live reload
