### A History of Programming and Other Such Ridiculous Things

Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Wozniak. These are all people who’ve never been in my kitchen. I’ve never had even a passing head nod with whilst coming out of the bathroom. What size shoes do they wear? What’s their favorite color? Do they know all the lyrics to Katy Perry’s Roar? I don’t know. But perhaps by taking a look at our collective past we can find these answers, and maybe learn a little bit about our future. Or at the very least we’ll get to see pictures of really big computers from the olden days!
