### Panel: The Future of Ruby

The sky is falling!!! Life as we know it is over! These pretzels are making me thirsty! There's been a lot of talk recently regarding the health of Ruby. Is it dying? Does it have Lupus? (Hint, it's never Lupus). I sit down with Sandi Metz, Ernie Miller, and Johnny Bourisquot for a candid discussion about what the future holds for one of our favorite languages.
